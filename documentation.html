<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h4>Process</h4>
<p>I started out my process for this project by brainstorming different game concepts. Having recently made
an infinite side-scroller before, I became attached to the genre and started playing those types of games, so
I thought I would make another one. I have also recently been playing several zombie games, so I thought to make
that my game's theme. Thus became the game concept. <p>
<p>I then began to fill out my game design treatment. I went through and marked it up the way I wanted my proposal
page to appear. After that was finished, I moved on to making the html pages. I found palettes and was somewhat inspired
by looking at other game websites, like Stardew Valley, on how to organize my page layouts. once I had an idea for
the layout, I started setting up my html and style sheets. Most of the styles I used were taught in class or 
I recalled them from my 110 class from last year. I obtained an appealing apocalyptic image for the cover page
and sketched up some concept art for my game in photoshop. Once I had my images, I went about applying the css
for when the screen is below 480px, putting in smaller images of the ones I had so they would fit on the screen
and I readjusted the navigation bar to be vertical rather than horizontal. With that, the prototype was complete.
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>At the moment, it is only a prototype of the final page I desire. There are some things I think might need changing 
like the background of the pages, but first I want to gather feedback and see if people like the color scheme and layout.
I would like to say, I was somewhat confused on what to put in this documentation section, for there was no real
guide on how to structure this page. </p>
