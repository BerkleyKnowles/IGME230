<h2 class="center">Time to Charge Into the Apocalypse!</h2>

<p id="intro">Welcome to the Apocalypse, soldier! Your base has just been overrun with zombies and you need to get out of there. 
Hop in the tank and start driving in this infinite side-scroller game. Dodge obsticles, shoot zombies, and collect supplies
as you traverse the fields. There are stations scattered about in need of supplies, fill them up and gain 
boosts to help you fight off the hordes of zombies attacking you. Live and fight as long as you can. Good luck.</p>

<h3>Dodge</h3>

<p>Watch out for debris! Running into obstacles results in damage to the tank. Too much and you could be stranded and die out there. 
Keep an eye on your health bar and collect tool boxes to fix up your damaged tank.<p>


<br>
<h3>Shoot Enemies</h3>

<p>You've got a tank for a reason! Fire at will, and take down as many zombies as you can. Watch out for specialty zombies and hordes.
In those cases, use powerups you've collected like bombs and shields to help you get past those pesky enemies.</p>


<br>
<h3>Collect</h3>

<p>There are several items out there to grab, you just need to make sure that you do! Supplies can be passed off to forts that will give you 
powerups and increased health in return. The fields have many objects available to find, and even some zombies might drop loot.</p>

<p>Come see how long you can last! play here: <a href="project.html">Apocalypse Run</a></p>
