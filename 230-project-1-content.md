# Apocalypse Run

1. ## High Concept
Shoot at incoming zombies and dodge hazardous obstacles as you travel in a tank to collect as 
many supplies as you can before the zombies get you.

2. ## Genre
Infinite side-scroller.

3. ## Platform
Desktop Only.

4. ## Story
The player is a soldier of a military base that had been turned into a makeshift city for survivers
of the apocalypse. Unfortunately, it was overrun, and zombies are everywhere. Barely escaping the base,
the player makes it their duty to kill as many zombies as possible and try to gather supplies to give
to other bases scattered about across the land. There is nowhere to return to. Only eventual death. 
But the player must do their best to stay alive and help others for as long as they can.

5. ## Esthetics
The game will have a darker cartoonish style with ambient looping music. There will be sounds for firing,
crashing, using special powerups, and a sound for the tank when driving. There will also be short music
tracks for when a horde is approaching to warn the player to get ready.

6. ## Gameplay
The player moves using the arrow or "asdw" keys on the keyboard. To fire at incoming enemies, the player 
must click where they want the missles to land. To use powerups, the player must click the button for them in the
bottom left corner. If it's an attack powerup, the next mouse click will be the location that attack
will land. For every station the player makes it to, the tank will automatically get a health bonus and if
provided with supplies the player collected (by driving over the items), they will be awarded extra powerups.
The goal of the game is to travel as far as possible while killing as many zombies as possible. The more kills,
the greater the player's score is in the end.
	###Teaching the Game/Player Learning
	The player will learn the objective and controls of the game on a pop up page that appears before the
	game starts. While playing, if the player collects a powerup for the first time, a pop up will appears
	to explain the use of that powerup. When the player first reaches a supply dropoff station, again, there
	will be a pop up page that explains how to interact with and use them.
